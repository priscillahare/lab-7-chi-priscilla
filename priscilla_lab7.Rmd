I am Priscilla and I am updating this markdown file here. 


```{r}

library(tidyverse)

gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

```

We are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or same diffuclty to get)?

Priscilla: data wrangling and counts
```{r}

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", 
         make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% #count function can give you counts for categorical data
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% #puts the df into a contingency table format
  select(-gender)

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female", "Male")


```
